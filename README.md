# ezlo-VeraBridge
Bridge selected devices from Vera to Ezlo Plus

Specify the Veras and devices to bridge to your Ezlo Plus in VeraBridge.json.

The plugin must be installed in /home/data/custome_plugins/VeraBridge

Note: The HC2 Lua deamon may crash when there are too many http requests to Veras. Ezlo is researching this issue with the http library.
